## Reflections:
##### 1. Some of my challenges encountered included time management where I have to juggle my own personal commitment with the CS50 curriculum. Next, the problem sets given are always critically demanding and the concepts taught every new week are akin from learning how to crawl to knowing how to fly an aeroplane.
##### 2. Regardless of the vigorous curriculum, it was a bittersweet experience. Thanks to the extensive resources provided by cs50x like the shorts, notes and walkthrough allowing me to have a more hands on approach to apply the key learning concepts from the lecture. Also the delivery of the course couldnâ€™t have been better thanks to the amazing staff support. Lastly, the flow of the curriculum is smooth.
